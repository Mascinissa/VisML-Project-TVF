TVF is a visualization framework for machine learning based performance models. This framework provides intuitive and interactive visualizations to help researchers gain insights into how these models operate under the hood. We will use a combination of existing data visualization techniques and new methods tailored to the specific challenges of machine learning based performance models. By creating a user-friendly tool for researchers to interact with these models, we hope to facilitate new insights, improve current techniques, and inspire new research directions.
